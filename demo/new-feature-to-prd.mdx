In this video, we quickly spin up a high-quality PRD for a new feature inside an existing product using Product Graph.

You'll see how Product Graph structures product artifacts and uses an agentic AI assistant to draft, refine, and keep requirements connected, so you can hand off a clear PRD to an engineering team, or take it straight into a coding agent like Cursor or Claude Code.
