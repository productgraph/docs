The Chat feature in Product Graph provides an intelligent conversational interface for working with your product documentation. Ask questions, refine requirements, and explore ideas with an AI assistant that understands your product context.

## Contextual Conversations

Chat in Product Graph isn't just a generic AI assistant—it's deeply integrated with your product documentation. The AI understands:

- Your existing artifacts and requirements
- Project context and goals
- Team terminology and conventions
- Historical decisions and their rationale
