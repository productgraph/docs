Documents in Product Graph provide flexible, rich-text pages for capturing information that doesn't fit neatly into structured artifacts. Use documents for research, meeting notes, reference materials, and more.

## Documents vs Artifacts

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Documents">
  Flexible, free-form content for:
  - Research and discovery notes
  - Meeting notes and summaries
  - Reference materials and guides
  - Draft ideas and brainstorming
  - Supporting documentation
</Tab>

<Tab title="Artifacts">
  Structured content for:
  - Requirements and specifications
  - User stories and acceptance criteria
  - Decision records
  - API documentation
  - Formal product definitions
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Start with a document when exploring ideas, then promote key content to
  structured artifacts when it's ready.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Keep documents focused">
  Each document should have a clear purpose. If a document covers too many topics, consider splitting it into multiple documents.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use descriptive titles">
  Write titles that describe the content clearly. Avoid generic names like
  "Notes" or "Draft" without context.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Link related content">
  Create links between documents and artifacts to build a connected knowledge
  base that's easy to navigate.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Promote to artifacts">
  When a document contains mature requirements or specifications, promote that content to a structured artifact for better organization and tooling integration.
