Product Artifacts are the building blocks of your product documentation in Product Graph. They provide a structured way to capture requirements, decisions, and context in a format that's both human-readable and AI-agent ready.

## What are Product Artifacts?

Product Artifacts are structured documents that capture the essential elements of your product—from high-level requirements to detailed specifications. Unlike traditional documents, artifacts are designed to be:

- **Structured**: Consistent format that makes information easy to find and parse
- **Connected**: Link artifacts together to show relationships and dependencies
- **AI-Ready**: Formatted for seamless integration with AI agents and development tools
- **Versioned**: Track changes and maintain history of your product decisions

## AI-Assisted Writing

Product Graph's AI assistant helps you create better artifacts by:

- Suggesting improvements to clarity and completeness
- Identifying missing requirements or edge cases
- Generating acceptance criteria from user stories
- Ensuring consistency across your documentation

<Tip>
  Use the AI assistant to transform rough notes into well-structured artifacts.
  Just paste your ideas and let the AI help organize them.
