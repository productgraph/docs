## Connecting Projects

Projects can be connected to show relationships:

- **Parent/child**: Break large initiatives into smaller projects
- **Dependencies**: Show when one project depends on another
- **Related**: Link projects that share context or affect each other

<Info>
  Connected projects help your team understand the broader context and avoid
  working in silos.
