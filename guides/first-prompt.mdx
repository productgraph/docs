  <Step title="Add Provider API key">
  <Note>**gpt-4o-mini** is free to use. However, if you want to use the playground or run evaluations with larger models, you will need to add a provider API key.</Note>
    Add your Anthropic or OpenAI API key on the ["Provider API
    Keys"](https://app.productgraph.ai/organization#/provider-api-keys) page.
