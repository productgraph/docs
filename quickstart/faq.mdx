### What is Product Graph?

Product Graph is a software requirements platform for AI-first teams that captures the what and why in a structured way. It helps you turn scattered ideas into a clear, structured set of product artifacts, paired with an AI assistant to help you move faster from idea to shovel-ready requirements. It enables real-time collaboration, AI-assisted writing, and structured documentation, integrating with tools like Notion, Confluence, Google Drive, Linear, and Jira to generate clear, agent-ready requirements.

### Which AI provider/models do you use?

Product Graph uses state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to power its features. We select models that offer the best balance of quality and speed, continuously refining our integrations and updating them as new models become available. The specific models utilized vary depending on the deployment and use case.

### Is my data or writing used to train any AI models?

No, your data or writing is not used to train any AI models. Product Graph prioritizes user privacy and ensures that your content remains secure and confidential.

### Are my documents private?

Yes, your documents are private. Product Graph employs robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, and secure storage, to protect your data. For enterprise users, additional features like private/self-hosted LLMs, SOC 2 compliance, and private deployments to secure private clouds are available. These options ensure that both enterprise and non-enterprise users can maintain full control over their data while benefiting from enhanced privacy and security.

### Can I use my own LLM model?

### Do you have a privacy policy?
