**Product Graph** is a software requirements platform for AI-first teams that captures the _what_ and _why_ in a structured way. It helps you turn scattered ideas into a clear, structured set of product artifacts, paired with an AI assistant to help you move faster from idea to shovel-ready requirements.

Modern teams build faster with AI coding agents, but the bottleneck has shifted to deciding what to build and why. Product context is scattered across docs and tools, inconsistent, and often outdated, making it hard for people and AI to rely on a single source of truth.

Product Graph enables real-time collaboration, AI-assisted writing, and structured documentation. It integrates with tools like Notion, Confluence, Google Drive, Linear, and Jira, and embeds into MCP-compatible IDEs and AI clients to generate clear, agent-ready requirements.

## AI-Native Editor

The editor integrates AI assistance directly into your writing workflow. Select any text to expand, summarize, or rewrite it. Every AI edit is presented as a tracked change you can accept or reject. Use slash commands to quickly insert headings, lists, tables, code blocks, and images. Reference other artifacts with `@mentions` to create navigable links across your documentation.

## Chat with Context

Have intelligent conversations with an AI assistant that understands your product documentation. Refine requirements, explore ideas, and generate drafts through natural conversation. Upload images and PDFs for additional context, and ask the AI to edit your document directly. All changes appear as tracked revisions for your review.

## Flexible Documents

Create general-purpose documents for meeting notes, research findings, decision records, and process documentation. Start from scratch or use built-in templates for common formats like lean canvases, six-pagers, and strategy documents. Cross-link documents to your product hierarchy with artifact mentions and attachments.

## Agent-Ready Projects

Structure your project documents for agents like Cursor, Devin, Claude, and Codex—your requirements translate directly into executable plans with goals, context, and acceptance criteria.

## Real-Time Collaboration

Work together with your team in real-time. Product Graph uses conflict-free data types to merge simultaneous edits automatically. No need to check out documents or worry about overwriting each other's work. Changes sync instantly across all connected users, and offline edits merge seamlessly when you reconnect.
