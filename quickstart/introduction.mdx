**Product Graph** is a software requirements platform for AI-first teams that captures the _what_ and _why_ in a structured way.

Modern teams build faster with AI coding agents, but the bottleneck has shifted to deciding what to build and why. Product context is scattered across docs and tools, inconsistent, and often outdated, making it hard for people and AI to rely on a single source of truth.

Product Graph enables real-time collaboration, AI-assisted writing, and structured documentation. It integrates with tools like Notion, Confluence, Google Drive, Linear, and Jira, and embeds into MCP-compatible IDEs and AI clients to generate clear, agent-ready requirements.

## AI-Native Editor

The AI-native editor is purpose-built for structured product writing. You can leverage AI to quickly draft, revise, and improve PRDs, initiatives, and feature docs, turning rough ideas into clear requirements in minutes.

## Partner with AI

A shared workspace where your AI product coach helps surface gaps, asks clarifying questions, and drives clarification and feedback so teams and agents align before building.

## Agent-Ready Projects

Structure your project documents for agents like Cursor, Devin, Claude, and Codex. With a full-featured MCP server, your requirements translate directly into executable plans with goals, context, and acceptance criteria.

## Integrations and Automation

Pull context from Notion, Confluence, and Google Drive. Push outputs to Linear and Jira. Keep docs in sync with agentic updates as requirements evolve, maintaining a connected source of truth across your entire workflow.

## Real-Time Collaboration

Work together with your team through real-time editing, ownership controls, review workflows, permissions, and standardized templates that reduce ambiguity and drift.
