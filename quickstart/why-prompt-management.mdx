## Why should I use an external prompt management platform?

Building and maintaining integrations with large language models (LLM) can be challenging. LLMs are inherently non-deterministic, and the landscape is rapidly evolving with new features, models, and providers emerging every month—each with its own data model. This makes it difficult to test, switch models, and keep your integration up to date. An external prompt management platform like Product Graph helps you navigate these challenges, enabling faster iterations and delivering a better experience for your customers.

**Decoupled**: Keep prompts separate from your codebase, allowing you to iterate quickly without waiting for full engineering releases.

**Test-Driven**: Confidently make changes and test new models by comparing results and iterating based on real-time feedback.

**Flexible Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with various LLM providers and models, making it easier to experiment with different options without significant rework.

**Monitoring**: Leverage built-in observability features to monitor prompt performance and make data-driven adjustments to improve outcomes.

**Collaborative**: Bring together technical and non-technical team members—such as developers, product managers, and QA—to refine your LLM configurations.

**Organized**: Manage all your LLM configurations in one place, with easy access to past versions and change history.
